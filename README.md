Final Project for the Hidden Genius Project
	Zombie Slayer Game ReadMe
1. Introduction
Welcome to Zombie Slayer, an exciting game where zombies spawn, and you must eliminate them before time runs out! In this game, you control a plane armed with bombs, and your mission is to use the arrows to navigate the plane, drop bombs with a command, and eliminate as many zombies as you can. You can also pause the game using the left control key. This ReadMe will guide you through the installation process, provide information about the technologies used, testing procedures, common bugs, and more.

2. Organizing Information
This ReadMe is organized into several sections to make it easily accessible:
General Information: This project is mainly for entertainment and the purpose of this was to create an open world game where you could fly forever but this game needs to have win/lose conditions.


Getting Started: Go to github click the link and your set. The arrow keys move , space the throttle command is to drop bombs and left control is to pause.


Common Problems and Bugs: In the options menu for the volume bar I’ve noticed that it works sometimes but not all I don’t know why but I’ve kept it there because on occasion it does control the volume.

4. Getting Started

5. Testing Procedures
